    "# Seaborn Plotting Exercises: Retail Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains 6 exercises to practice plotting with Seaborn using a retail dataset. The dataset (`df_retail`) contains transaction records with columns such as `TransactionID`, `CustomerName`, `Age`, `Gender`, `ProductCategory`, `ProductPrice`, `Quantity`, `Discount`, `Total`, `TransactionDate`, `PaymentMethod`, `Country`, `City`, `LoyaltyMember`, and `ShippingCost`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: Create various Seaborn plots to explore and visualize patterns in the retail data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions**:\n",
    "- The first code cell loads the dataset. Run it to create `df_retail`.\n",
    "- For each exercise, write Seaborn code to generate the requested plot.\n",
    "- Ensure you include titles and appropriate axis labels for clarity.\n",
    "- Use the `deep` palette and `whitegrid` theme unless specified otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites**:\n",
    "- Import Seaborn and Matplotlib: `import seaborn as sns` and `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`.\n",
    "- Set the theme: `sns.set_theme(style='whitegrid', palette='deep')`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete each exercise in the provided code cells."
